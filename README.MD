Guidelines

General guidelines:
- Follow the instructions in order - do not skip ahead
- After each step, commit your changes to GitHub and tag it clearly
- There is no fixed time limit for the test but we do not expect to see any extended gaps between commits
- Please follow an Object Oriented and TDD based approach
- Aim for the simplest solution (i.e. minimal amount of code) which fully solves the problem
- We are equally interested in how you tested your implementation as the implementation itself.


Test description
- Create an Apple
- The apple has a colour, weight, taste (allowed values: 1, 2, 3, 4), a flag which indicates whether it has a worm in it
- The apple can weigh between 10g and 100g
- The apple can be either green, red, or blue
- The apple can either be peeled or eaten.
- Before eating the apple, it needs to be peeled.
- An apple can only be peeled if it does not have a worm in it and its taste is > 3
- Green and red apples can be easily peeled by any peeler, but blue apples can only be peeled with a special peeler (Valyrian steel peeler?).
